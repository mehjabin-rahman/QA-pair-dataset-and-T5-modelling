# Create QA Pair Dataset and T5 Modelling

## Overview
This project aims to create a dataset of question-answer pairs and utilize the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model for various natural language processing tasks. The goal is to facilitate the training and evaluation of models that can generate or classify question-answer pairs effectively.

## Features
- **Dataset Creation**: Generate a high-quality dataset of question-answer pairs from various sources.
- **T5 Model Integration**: Leverage the T5 model for tasks such as question generation, answering, and classification.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Implement metrics to evaluate the performance of the model on the generated dataset.

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
